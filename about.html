With a population of approximately 117 million, the country is currently one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, with a projected GDP growth of 5.9% to 6.2% for 2026, driven by robust domestic consumption, infrastructure projects under the "Build Better More" program, and a thriving business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. As of January 2026, the nation is intensifying its focus on renewable energy and maritime security while preparing for the critical 2026 midterm elections (following the May 2025 cycle) that will shape the final half of the current administration's term. A key member of ASEAN, the Philippines continues to leverage its strategic location in the Indo-Pacific to strengthen international trade alliances while promoting its diverse tourism industry across its more than 7,000 islands.</p>

    <h1>Maldives</h1>
    <p>In 2026, the Maldives, officially the Republic of Maldives, is an archipelagic nation in the Indian Ocean led by President Mohamed Muizzu. With a population of approximately 520,000, the country has recently transitioned from its "India Out" campaign toward a pragmatic "India First" diplomatic reset, securing significant debt relief and infrastructure support from New Delhi in early 2026. The economy remains heavily dependent on luxury tourism, which accounts for over 25% of its GDP, and the government is currently prioritizing the Velana International Airport expansion and the "Ras Malé" land reclamation project to combat the existential threat of rising sea levels. As one of the world's most climate-vulnerable nations, the Maldives continues to lead international advocacy for environmental sustainability while managing its strategic position as a vital maritime hub in South Asia.</p>
